# Real-Time-Tesla-Stock-Price-Forecasting

Developed an AI-powered Tesla stock price forecasting model

ðŸ“Œ Collected and preprocessed Tesla (TSLA) stock data from yfinance, engineered key features (SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands), and implemented an LSTM neural network for time-series predictions.

Achieved 90.13% accuracy in stock price prediction

ðŸ“Œ Trained and fine-tuned the LSTM model, splitting data into train-test sets and optimizing performance. Model evaluation achieved a 90.13% RÂ² score, demonstrating strong predictive capability for financial trends.

Implemented real-time forecasting within Jupyter Notebook/VS Code

ðŸ“Œ The trained model fetches live Tesla stock data, preprocesses it, and forecasts the next valid trading day's stock price
